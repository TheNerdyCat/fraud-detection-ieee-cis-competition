# fraud-detection-ieee-cis-competition
IEEE Computational Intelligence Society - Fraud Detection Competition (Kaggle)

## Introduction

I did not enter this competition whilst it was open, but rather did it retrospectively. 

## Submission

Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

For each TransactionID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the isFraud variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

`TransactionID,isFraud`<br/>
`3663549,0.5`<br/>
`3663550,0.5`<br/>
`3663551,0.5`<br/>
`etc.`<br/>
